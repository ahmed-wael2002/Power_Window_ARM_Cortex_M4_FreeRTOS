# Power Window Control System

### üöó Project Overview
This project showcases a **Power Window Control System** designed for modern vehicles using the **Tiva C microcontroller** and **FreeRTOS**. The system is scalable, configurable, and integrates various functionalities such as manual and automatic window control, obstacle detection, and safety features. It ensures compatibility across different vehicle models.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Manual & Automatic Control:**
  - **Manual Mode:** Continuous press for precise window control.
  - **Automatic Mode:** One-touch for full open/close functionality.
- **Driver and Passenger Control Board:**
  - Provides window control from driver control board (higher priority) or passenger control board.
- **Window Lock Function:**
  - Locks all windows except the driver's for enhanced security.
- **Jam Protection:**
  - Detects obstacles during the one-touch auto-close operation then retreats the window for safety.
- **Highly Configurable:**
  - Provides manual configuration through MACROS for adapting the project into any hardware architecture.
- **Templates:**
  - Provides sample demo project for easier integration.
